# Supply Chain Management

A supply chain management solution to track the movement of goods from the manufacturer to the end consumer, ensuring transparency and authenticity.
Explanation:

The contract defines a Product struct to store information about each registered product, including its unique product ID, producer's address, name, description, creation time, transit times, and status.

The ProductStatus enum tracks the different stages of the product's lifecycle (Created, InTransit, Delivered).

Users with the role of "producer" can register new products on the blockchain using the registerProduct function.

Users can update the status of a product using the updateProductStatus function, allowing for tracking the product's movement along the supply chain.

The contract keeps track of the transit stops for each product using the productTransitStops mapping.

Users can verify the authenticity of a product using the verifyProductAuthenticity function.

The getProductTransitStops function allows users to view the transit stops for a specific product.

The getProductInformation function provides detailed information about a product, including its current status and authenticity.

Please note that this is a simplified version, and a real-world Supply Chain Management system would require additional features and security considerations. For example, you may want to consider adding access control mechanisms to limit certain functions to specific roles or parties. Additionally, you might include more advanced tracking mechanisms and interfaces to integrate with external systems. Always conduct thorough testing and ensure security before deploying smart contracts in a production environment.
